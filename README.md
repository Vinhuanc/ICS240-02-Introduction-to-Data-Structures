### Notes📝
Stacks vs Queues

Queue: First In, First Out. FIFO(checkout line)
- Items can be inserted at one end(tail) and removed only the other end(head)
- Ad elements in the queue at any point of time
- Can remove/read only the element at the front of the queue
- Stack can be implemented using array or linkedlist

Stack: Last In, First Out. LIFO(stack of plates)
- Only have access to the element at the top of the stack(pop)
- Stack can be implemented using array or linkedlist
